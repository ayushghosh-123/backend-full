# Scalable React Frontend Folder Structure (Beginner Friendly)

This structure is designed for both beginners and advanced developers. It keeps your code organized, easy to maintain, and ready to scale as your project grows.

---

## Recommended Folder Structure

```
src/
│
├── api/                # All API calls and services (e.g., axios instances)
│
├── assets/             # Images, fonts, icons, and other static files
│
├── components/         # Reusable UI components (Button, Navbar, Loader, etc.)
│
├── features/           # Each main feature/page of your app gets its own folder
│   ├── Auth/           # Authentication (login, register, etc.)
│   │   ├── components/ # Auth-specific components
│   │   ├── hooks/      # Auth-specific custom hooks
│   │   ├── services/   # Auth-related API calls
│   │   ├── AuthPage.jsx
│   │   └── authSlice.js
│   ├── User/           # User profile, settings, etc.
│   │   ├── components/
│   │   ├── hooks/
│   │   ├── services/
│   │   ├── UserPage.jsx
│   │   └── userSlice.js
│   └── ...             # More features as your app grows
│
├── hooks/              # Custom hooks used across the whole app
│
├── layouts/            # Layout components (e.g., MainLayout, AuthLayout)
│
├── pages/              # Top-level pages for routing (Home, About, NotFound, etc.)
│
├── routes/             # Route definitions and route guards
│
├── store/              # Global state management (Redux, Zustand, Context, etc.)
│
├── styles/             # Global styles, CSS, SCSS, Tailwind config, etc.
│
├── utils/              # Utility functions and helpers
│
├── App.jsx             # Main app component
└── main.jsx            # Entry point (Vite) or index.js (Create React App)
```

## How to Use This Structure

- **api/**: Put all your API logic here. Example: `api/userApi.js`
- **assets/**: Store images, SVGs, fonts, etc.
- **components/**: Place reusable UI elements here (e.g., `Button.jsx`, `Navbar.jsx`).
- **features/**: Each major feature (like Auth, User, Dashboard) gets its own folder. Inside each, you can have components, hooks, services, and state logic.
- **hooks/**: For custom React hooks that are used in multiple places.
- **layouts/**: For layout wrappers (e.g., a layout with sidebar and header).
- **pages/**: For top-level pages that are routed (e.g., Home, About).
- **routes/**: For route configuration and protection (e.g., PrivateRoute).
- **store/**: For global state (Redux slices, context providers, etc.).
- **styles/**: For global CSS or styling frameworks.
- **utils/**: For helper functions (e.g., `formatDate.js`, `validateEmail.js`).

## Example: Adding a New Feature

Suppose you want to add a "Blog" feature:

```
src/
  features/
    Blog/
      components/
        BlogList.jsx
        BlogPost.jsx
      hooks/
        useBlogPosts.js
      services/
        blogApi.js
      BlogPage.jsx
      blogSlice.js
```

---

## Tips for Beginners

- Start simple: You don’t need all folders at first. Add them as your app grows.
- Keep components small and focused.
- Use `features/` for anything that is a main part of your app (like Auth, User, Blog, etc.).
- Use `components/` for things you reuse everywhere (like buttons, modals, etc.).
- Use `pages/` for things that are direct routes in your app.

---

## Example File: `src/features/Auth/AuthPage.jsx`

```jsx
import LoginForm from './components/LoginForm';
import RegisterForm from './components/RegisterForm';

export default function AuthPage() {
  return (
    <div>
      <LoginForm />
      <RegisterForm />
    </div>
  );
}
```
