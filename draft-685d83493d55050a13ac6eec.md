# Refresh Token

### A refresh token is a credential used in authentication systems to obtain a new access token without requiring the user to log in again. It is commonly used in systems implementing OAuth2 or JWT-based authentication.

### üîÅ **How Refresh Token Works**

1. **Login**  
    User logs in with username/password. The server returns:
    
    * **Access token** (short-lived)
        
    * **Refresh token** (long-lived)
        
2. **Access token is used** to authenticate API requests.
    
3. **When access token expires**, the client sends the **refresh token** to the server to get a **new access token**.
    
4. If the refresh token is valid, the server:
    
    * Generates a new access token (and sometimes a new refresh token)
        
    * Sends it back to the client
        

### üîí **Where to Store Tokens?**

* **Access Token**: Store in memory (recommended) or in HttpOnly cookie
    
* **Refresh Token**: Store in secure, HttpOnly cookie to avoid XSS attacks
    

## **Example Flow (JWT-Based)**

`// Step: Client requests new access token fetch('/api/refresh-token', { method: 'POST', credentials: 'include',`

`// To include HttpOnly cookie });`

`// Step: Server verifies and issues new token const decoded = jwt.verify(refreshToken, process.env.REFRESH_TOKEN_SECRET);`

`const newAccessToken = jwt.sign({ id:` [`decoded.id`](http://decoded.id) `}, process.env.ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET, { expiresIn: "15m", });`

# **Access Token**

The access token plays a crucial role in authenticating API requests. It is designed to be short-lived to enhance security, ensuring that even if compromised, the potential damage is limited. For optimal security, it is recommended to store the access token in memory or in an HttpOnly cookie, which helps protect it from cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks. This thoughtful approach to token storage is essential in maintaining the integrity and security of user sessions.
